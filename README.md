# Project #3: Turing Machine Simulator

* Authors: Eric Johnson and Andrew Kobus
* Class: CS361 Section 002
* Semester: Spring 2025

## Overview
This program simulates a bi-infinite TM. A Turing machine is a hypothetical device that manipulates symbols on a strip
of tape according to a table of rules. Despite its simplicity, a Turing machine can
be adapted to simulate the logic of any computer algorithm, and is particularly
useful in explaining the functions of a CPU inside a computer.
